# Background
Pandamonium is a fullstack social media app created to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for the LGBTQ community and allies. Account holders can create a profile linked to a certain are (city/state) and will be directed to that region's main forum. All users in a given regional forum can make posts to that forum as well as make comments to such posts. Posts/comments can also be downvoted/upvoted by users. User profiles can be customized with a short bio and a unique avatar. There is also a built-in 'anonymous' function to help users ease in and settle into their community.  
  
Pandamonium was built on a MongoDB backend framework, to structure essential user data and location data/functionality. Mongoose ODM was used to map data from the backend as Javascript objects. React and Redux was utilized to connect backend data to a clean and intuitive user-interface. Google maps API was implemented to identify city/state locations and to link such locations to forums and users.
